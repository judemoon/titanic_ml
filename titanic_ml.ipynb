    "The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will analyze what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, I will apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is to keep notes as I work through the project and show my thought processes and approaches to solve this problem.\n",
